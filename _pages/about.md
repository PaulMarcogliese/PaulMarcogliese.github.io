I am interested in the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying neurological disease. While the etiology of diseases like Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Parkinson's disease is complex, the study and identification genes responsible for rare disorders can offer insight into more common conditions. To support the discovery and characterization of novel genes involved in a variety of ill-defined neurological conditions, I am part of the Model Organism Screening Center (MOSC) under the umbrella of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). The UDN uses next-generation sequencing (whole-genome and whole-exome) to identify candidate causative gene variant(s) in patients. To support the molecular diagnosis, we use a range of techniques in Drosophila to assess the functional consequences of the patient variant in vivo. Additionally, rapid generation of Drosophila with strong loss of function alleles in these genes provides a phenotyping and screening platform for subsequent mechanistic studies and drug testing. Currently my work is largely focused on elucidating the mechanism underlying IRF2BPL-related neuroregression and associated ASD. Using flies, mice and patient cells, I am employing a multi-systems approach to better understand the function of IRF2BPL.
