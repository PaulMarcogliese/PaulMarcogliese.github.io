<p>My work in rare diseases impacts people from diverse backgrounds, including racialized and indigenous minorities and I believe that greater Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) in the lab will lead to better outcomes for these patients.</p>

<p>Outside of the lab, I am fortunate to get to spend my time with my family that includes an incredible partner and two amazing daughters.</p>
