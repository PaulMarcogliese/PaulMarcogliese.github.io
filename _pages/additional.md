<p>I started my science training taking high school science courses after I had already completed a Bachelor of Arts degree. I stood out from my classmates, and being a non-typical student gave me some insight into being different from the majority. Although I have worked hard to achieve my professional success, I acknowledge that my identity has conferred benefits and privileges to me that are not available to others. While I did not ask for these privileges, I sincerely believe that it is incumbent upon me to work towards more equity in science and to consciously address the blind-spots that I have.</p>

<p>My work in rare diseases impacts people from diverse backgrounds, including racialized and indigenous minorities and I believe that greater Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) in the lab will lead to better outcomes for these patients.</p>

<p>Outside of the lab, I am fortunate to get to spend my time with my family that includes an incredible partner and two amazing daughters.</p>
